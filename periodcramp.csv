30000430,Domperidone,"None: Domperidone is not approved for marketing in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but is available in other countries. Domperidone may also be available from some compounding pharmacies and via the internet in the US. The quality of such products cannot be assured, and the FDA has warned against their use.[1] Data available from 4 small studies on the excretion of domperidone into breastmilk are somewhat inconsistent, but infants would probably receive less than 0.1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage, even at high maternal doses. No adverse effects have been found in a limited number of published cases of breastfed infants whose mothers were taking domperidone. Domperidone is sometimes used as a galactogogue to increase milk supply.[2,3] and has been used in induced lactation by adoptive and transgender women.[4-11] Galactogogues should never replace evaluation and counseling on modifiable factors that affect milk production.[12,13] Most mothers who are provided instruction in good breastfeeding technique and breastfeed frequently are unlikely to obtain much additional benefit from domperidone. Several meta-analyses of domperidone use as a galactogogue in mothers of preterm infants concluded that domperidone can increase milk production acutely in the range of 90 to 94 mL daily.[3,14,15] The most recent and largest meta-analysis concluded that domperidone is more effective than placebo as a galactogogue, but only in the mothers of preterm infants and that 30 mg daily for 7 days is the optimal dose.[16] Other reviewers concluded that improvement of breastfeeding practices seems more effective and safer than off-label use of domperidone.[17,18] One retrospective study found that breastmilk feeding rates at discharge remained consistently lower in very preterm (<32 weeks gestation) infants of women dispensed domperidone than those who were not prescribed domperidone.[19] Domperidone has no officially established dosage for increasing milk supply. Most published studies have used domperidone in a dosage of 10 mg 3 times daily for 4 to 10 days. Two small studies found no statistically significant additional increase in milk output with a dosage of 20 mg 3 times daily compared to a dosage of 10 mg 3 times and that women who failed to respond to the low dosage did not respond to the higher dosage.[20,21] Dosages greater than 30 mg daily may increase the risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in patients receiving domperidone,[22] although some feel that the risk is less in nursing mothers because of their relatively younger age.[23] Large database retrospective cohort studies in Canada found an increase in the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, but some confounders make the results subject to question.[24,25] In one case, domperidone use uncovered congenital long QT syndrome in a woman who developed loss of consciousness, behavioral arrest, and jerking while taking domperidone.[26] Mothers with a history of cardiac arrhythmias should not receive domperidone and all mothers should be advised to stop taking domperidone and seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs or symptoms of an abnormal heart rate or rhythm while taking domperidone, including dizziness, palpitations, syncope or seizures.[22] Maternal side effects of domperidone reported in galactogogue studies and cases reported to the FDA include dry mouth, headache, dizziness, nausea, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, palpitations malaise, and shortness of breath. Some of these were more frequent with dosages greater than with 30 mg daily.[20,21,27-29] Surveys of women taking domperidone for lactation enhancement found gastrointestinal symptoms, breast engorgement, weight gain, headache, dizziness, irritability, dry mouth and fatigue were the most common side effects reported.[30-32] One mother taking domperidone 20 mg three times daily as a galactogogue for feeding her adoptive daughter developed obsessional thoughts with adjustment disorder. This manifested as thoughts of killing her daughter. Stopping domperidone and instituting duloxetine therapy resulted in remission over a 10-month period.[33] Canadian health authorities found an association between the abrupt discontinuation or tapering of domperidone used for lactation stimulation and the development of psychiatric adverse events.[34] Canadian labeling warns against use of domperidone doses greater than 30 mg daily for longer than 4 weeks. Drug withdrawal symptoms consisting of insomnia, anxiety, and tachycardia were reported in a woman taking 80 mg of domperidone daily for 8 months as a galactogogue who abruptly tapered the dosage over 3 days.[35] Another mother took domperidone 10 mg three times daily for 10 months as a galactagogue and stopped abruptly. After discontinuation, she experienced severe insomnia, severe anxiety, severe cognitive problems and depression.[36] A third postpartum woman began domperidone 90 mg daily, increasing to 160 mg daily to increase her milk supply. Because her milk supply did not improve, she stopped nursing at 14 weeks and began to taper the domperidone dosage by 10 mg every 3 to 4 days. Seven days after discontinuing domperidone, she began experiencing insomnia, rigors, severe psychomotor agitation, and panic attacks. She restarted the drug at 90 mg daily and tapered the dose by 10 mg daily each week. At a dose of 20 mg daily, the same symptoms recurred. She required sertraline, clonazepam and reinstitution of domperidone at 40 mg daily, slowly tapering the dose over 8 weeks. Three months were required to fully resolve her symptoms.[37] In a fourth case, a mother took domperidone 20 mg four times daily for 9 months to stimulate breastmilk production. She stopped breastfeeding and domperidone at that time. Two weeks later, she presented with insomnia, anxiety, nausea, headaches and palpitations. The drug was restarted at a dosage of 20 mg three times daily and began to taper the daily dosage by 10 mg every week, but after one week she complained of insomnia. Tapering was reduced to 5 mg every week, but whenever she stopped the drug, symptoms returned. She was able to discontinue domperidone after tapering the daily dosage by 2.5 mg weekly over 10 months.[38] A fifth case of a mother with a history of bipolar disorder and major depression developed severe anxiety, a recurrence of depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder 6 days after abruptly discontinuing domperidone 120 mg daily that she was taking as a galactogogue. Three days later, she restarted domperidone 120 mg daily and tapered her daily dose by 10 mg at weekly intervals. She took no other medications. Two weeks after discontinuing domperidone, she had signs of only mild mood disorder.[39] Three patients were reported to have severe symptoms of withdrawal (depression, reemergence of obsessive-compulsive disorder and major depressive disorder, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, poor concentration, loss of libido, lack of energy, suicidality, hot flashes, night sweats, hair thinning, and dry eyes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and decreased appetite) after stopping domperidone as a galactogogue. Dosages ranged from 90 to 150 mg daily for 5 to 32 weeks. Dosages required a slow hyperbolic tapering over a period of several months to fully discontinue the drug.[40]",N/A,2025,N/A,N/A,Drugs and Lactation Database (LactMed®),N/A,https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30000430,N/A,N/A,N/A
39832976,Seeking abortion medications online: experiences from a mystery client study in Colombia.,"OBJECTIVES: While Colombians gained broad legal access to abortion in 2022, people still lack knowledge about its availability and face variable quality of care at health facilities. This study sought to understand whether online sellers provide the instructions and medication dosages necessary for effective medication abortions.
DESIGN: The study design involved mystery clients contacting sellers identified across websites and social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok) to purchase abortion pills. Unique sellers were contacted with two profiles (first and second trimester pregnancy gestational ages). Mystery clients documented information received on physical effects, complications and how to take the pills from the sellers in a predesigned survey in SurveyCTO.
SETTING: The study was conducted in Colombia from July to September 2023. We documented and described sellers' conversations with mystery clients and pills received. We identified 161 sellers across platforms, which resulted in 65 unique sellers after deduplication. We attempted to contact each unique seller twice.
RESULTS: Almost all sellers screened for gestational age using last menstrual period. Bleeding (84.6%) and cramping (66.7%) were the physical effects most commonly mentioned to mystery clients, although pain was mentioned to second trimester clients more often than first (40.5% vs 22.0%). Less than 17% of sellers highlighted possible complications that could require medical attention. Almost 90% of purchases were received (88.9%). All contained manufacturer-branded misoprostol and 77.5% were undamaged aluminium blister packages. While 82.6% of first trimester clients were instructed to take an initial misoprostol dosage in line with Colombia's Ministry of Health guidelines, all second trimester clients were told to take a dosage exceeding the recommended amount. Although most sellers provided appropriate information on administration routes for the pills, sellers also provided contradictory and unnecessary instructions.
CONCLUSION: Online sellers of abortion pills may persist even as legal abortion becomes more widely available in Colombia. While misoprostol was received from many of these sellers, they did not provide sufficient information about potential complications or accurate dosing instructions to second trimester clients. Accurate medication abortion information specific to Colombia should be made more accessible so that people can more easily navigate the new care landscape.","Arango DA, Cartwright AF, Braccia A, Moore A, Vivas MM",2025,15,1,BMJ Open,"Arango DA, et al.

39839226,"Primary dysmenorrhea and its associated factors among female high school students in Nekemte town, East Wallaga Zone, Western Oromia, Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study.","BACKGROUND: Primary dysmenorrhea is a common gynecological problem characterized by recurrent, periodical, and cramping pain in the lower abdomen that occurs before or during menstruation, usually without pelvic disease. Its magnitude has not been well studied; some of the associated factors are inconclusive. Therefore, the goal of this study was to fill gaps on the magnitude, and associated factors of primary dysmenorrhea among female high school students in Nekemte town.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the magnitude of primary dysmenorrhea, its associated factors among high school students in Nekemte town, East Wallaga, Western Oromia, Ethiopia, 2023.
METHODS: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among high school students in Nekemte town from June 05 to 19, 2023. The calculated total sample size was 534, and data were collected from four governmental high schools and one private high school that were selected by multistage stratified sampling. The collected data were entered into Epi Info version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 25. Binary and multivariable logistic regressions were used to find associations between dependent and independent variables.
RESULTS: The magnitude of primary dysmenorrhea was 68.4% (95% CI = 64.3%, 72.0%). Anxiety (AOR = 2.41, 95% CI = 1.31, 4.43), family history of primary dysmenorrhea (AOR = 4.64, 95% CI = 2.74, 7.86), sexual intercourse (AOR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.21, 0.55), drinking tea <4 cups per day (AOR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.22, 0.60), and physical activity (AOR = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.03, 0.11) were factors associated with primary dysmenorrhea.
CONCLUSION: The magnitude of primary dysmenorrhea was high among high school students in the study area. Sexual intercourse, physical activity, drinking tea, anxiety, and family history of primary dysmenorrhea were significantly associated with primary dysmenorrhea.","Gindaba BG, Abera Gudeta T, Sebu LD, Zerihun Gindaba E, Abdisa MT",2024,6,N/A,Front Reprod Health,"Gindaba BG, et al.

39861123,Preliminary Study by Differential Scanning Calorimetric Analysis of Red Blood Cells in Peripheral Artery Disease Patients Treated with Cilostazol: Correlation with Improvements in Walking Distance.,"Objective: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a prevalent vascular condition characterized by arterial narrowing, which impairs blood flow and manifests as intermittent claudication, a pain or cramping sensation induced by physical activity or ambulation. Walking distance is a crucial clinical indicator of peripheral artery disease, and it correlates with the disease severity and risk of mortality. It reflects the severity of the disease, with reduced mobility indicating an increased risk of morbidity. It can also inform on the efficacy of the treatment. Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, has been demonstrated to enhance walking distance in patients with peripheral artery disease through the dilation of blood vessels and the inhibition of platelet aggregation. With this preliminary study, we aimed to elucidate other possible effects of cilostazol, specifically its influence on the structural properties of red blood cells. Methods: 10 patients (5 men, 5 women) with PAD were treated with cilostazol over a three-month period. Its biochemical effects on RBCs were determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Patient's blood samples were collected at the start of treatment, then after two weeks, one month, two months, and three months of therapy. Results: The DSC analysis revealed shifts in thermal properties, including change in peak (melting or denaturation) temperature (T<sub>p</sub>) and calorimetric enthalpy (ΔH<sub>cal</sub>), which indicate significant structural changes in red blood cells. These thermal property changes correlated with clinical improvements in walking distance reported by patients. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that cilostazol induces substantial biochemical modifications in red blood cells, enhancing their functional properties and contributing to improved clinical outcomes. This study highlights the potential of differential scanning calorimetry as an adjunctive method for assessing the effectiveness of treatments for peripheral artery disease at the cellular level. However, further investigation with larger patient cohorts is required to confirm these initial results.","Lőrinczy D, Szabó D, Benkő L",2025,18,1,Pharmaceuticals (Basel),"Lőrinczy D, et al.

40036152,"Higher dose corticosteroids in hospitalised COVID-19 patients requiring ventilatory support (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial.","BACKGROUND: Low dose corticosteroids (e.g., 6 mg dexamethasone) have been shown to reduce mortality for hypoxic COVID-19 patients. We have previously reported that higher dose corticosteroids cause harm in patients with clinical hypoxia but not receiving ventilatory support (the combination of non-invasive mechanical ventilation, including high-flow nasal oxygen, continuous positive airway pressure and bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation), but the balance of efficacy and safety in patients receiving ventilatory support is uncertain.
METHODS: This randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]) assessed multiple possible treatments in patients hospitalised for COVID-19. Eligible and consenting adult patients receiving ventilatory support were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual care with higher dose corticosteroids (dexamethasone 20 mg once daily for 5 days followed by 10 mg once daily for 5 days or until discharge if sooner) or usual standard of care alone (which includes dexamethasone 6 mg once daily for 10 days or until discharge if sooner). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality; secondary outcomes were duration of hospitalisation and (among participants not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline) the composite of invasive mechanical ventilation or death. Recruitment closed on 31 March 2024 when funding for the trial ended. The RECOVERY trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).
FINDINGS: Between 25 May 2021 and 9 January 2024, 477 COVID-19 patients receiving ventilatory support were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus higher dose corticosteroids vs. usual care alone (of whom 99% received corticosteroids during the follow-up period). Of those randomised, 221 (46%) were in Asia, 245 (51%) in the UK and 11 (2%) in Africa. 143 (30%) had diabetes mellitus. Overall, 86 (35%) of 246 patients allocated to higher dose corticosteroids vs. 86 (37%) of 231 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio [RR] 0.87; 95% CI 0.64-1.18; p = 0.37). There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (128 [52%] in the higher dose corticosteroids group vs. 120 [52%] in the usual care group; RR 1.04, 0.81-1.33]; p = 0.78). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, there was no clear reduction in the proportion meeting the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (76 [37%] of 206 vs. 93 [45%] of 205; RR 0.79 [95% CI 0.63-1.00]; p = 0.05).
INTERPRETATION: In patients hospitalised for COVID-19 receiving ventilatory support, we found no evidence that higher dose corticosteroids reduced the risk of death compared to usual care, which included low dose corticosteroids.

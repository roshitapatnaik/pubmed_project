40065908,Saccharomyces boulardii Alleviates Colitis by Regulating FXR-NLRP3 Mediated Macrophage Pyroptosis.,"BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC), a typical inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is pathologically defined by mucosal inflammation confined to the colonic mucosa. Saccharomyces boulardii (Sb), a commonly utilized probiotic yeast for managing digestive disorders like UC, has not been thoroughly investigated regarding its precise mechanisms for alleviating colitis. Increasing evidence indicates the involvement of FXR in UC. Meanwhile, the regulatory role of FXR on NLRP3 has garnered increasing attention. This study investigated the therapeutic effects of Sb supernatant (SbS) on colitis and elucidated the role of the FXR-NLRP3 signaling pathway in this process.
METHODS: A murine model of colitis was established through administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), followed by oral gavage with either SbS or the control Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB) culture medium. The FXR activation, NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition, and macrophage pyroptosis were evaluated both in vivo and in vitro. The effects of SbS in activating FXR, suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome and alleviating the colitis were assessed.
RESULTS: SbS ameliorated symptoms of DSS-induced colitis. Our data demonstrated that SbS elicited activation of FXR and concomitantly suppressed NLRP3 expression within the colonic tissue samples. Additionally, SbS was further observed to suppress the expression of cleaved caspase-1, a key effector protein in pyroptosis process, within the F4/80+ macrophage population. Moreover, SbS modulated the expression of genes and proteins associated with pyroptosis, collectively suggesting its potential to ameliorate intestinal pyroptosis, potentially via its direct impact on macrophage. Consistently, SbS ameliorated pyroptosis of macrophages in vitro through activating FXR and inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome. However, the therapeutic effect of SbS was reversed by the FXR inhibitor, guggulsterone, resulting in increased levels of pyroptosis-related proteins.
CONCLUSION: SbS demonstrated a beneficial effect in alleviating UC by modulating the FXR-NLRP3 signaling pathway, thereby mitigating macrophage pyroptosis. This discovery presents new insights into effects of Sb on alleviating UC.","Yang L, Li W, Zhao Q, Mo Q, Liu T, Cao H",2025,18,N/A,J Inflamm Res,"Yang L, et al.

40066075,Arterialized Venous Free Flap for Hand Defect Reconstruction Due to Ischemic Steal Syndrome.,"Ischemic steal syndrome (ISS) occurs in hemodialysis patients. Hence, it rarely becomes gangrene or disrupts hand function. We reported a patient with an ISS and radial atherosclerosis that presented with infected ulcer. The patient was treated with arterialized venous free flap from the contralateral forearm. Dialysis access can be used as early as 10 days after the flap. The report also describes the long-term functional follow-up after reconstruction. Although there was superficial flap necrosis, this non-physiologic flap can preserve the patient's hand function.","Septrina R, Hapsari P, Widarda IR, Lesmana R, Rudiman R, Abdulah R, Febrina A",2025,18,N/A,Int Med Case Rep J,"Septrina R, et al.

40066272,The landscape of biofilm models for phage therapy: mimicking biofilms in diabetic foot ulcers using 3D models.,"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) affect up to 15-25% of patients suffering from diabetes and are considered a global health concern. These ulcers may result in delayed wound healing and chronic infections, with the potential to lead to amputations. It has been estimated that 85% of diabetes-related amputations are preceded by a diagnosis of DFU. A critical factor in the persistence of this disease is the presence of polymicrobial biofilms, which generally include Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. The involvement of diabetic comorbidities such as ischemia, hyperglycemia, and immune-compromised status creates a perfect niche for these bacteria to evade the body's immune response and persist as biofilms. Bacteriophage therapy can target and lyse specific bacteria and is emerging as an effective treatment for biofilm-related infections. While this treatment shows promise in addressing chronic wounds, our current models, including animal and static systems, fail to capture the full complexity of DFU. Innovative approaches such as 3D bioengineered skin models, organoid models, and hydrogel-based systems are being developed to simulate DFU microenvironments more accurately in 3D without using ex vivo or animal tissues. These advanced models are critical for evaluating bacteriophage efficacy in biofilm-associated DFU, aiming to enhance preclinical assessments and improve therapeutic outcomes for DFU patients.","Martinet MG, Thomas M, Bojunga J, Pletz MW, Vehreschild MJGT, Würstle S",2025,16,N/A,Front Microbiol,"Martinet MG, et al.

40066291,Asiaticoside-nitric oxide synergistically accelerate diabetic wound healing by regulating key metabolites and SRC/STAT3 signaling.,"BACKGROUND: Diabetic wounds pose significant clinical challenges due to impaired healing processes, often resulting in chronic, nonhealing ulcers. Asiaticoside (AC), a natural triterpene derivative from Centella asiatica, has demonstrated notable anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties. However, the synergistic effects of nitric oxide (NO)-a recognized promoter of wound healing-combined with AC in treating diabetic wounds remain inadequately explored.
METHODS: Ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was utilized to identify differential metabolites and dysregulated metabolic pathways associated with diabetic wounds. Molecular docking analyses were conducted to confirm the binding affinity of AC to key therapeutic targets. The effects of asiaticoside-nitric oxide hydrogel (ACNO) on gene and protein expression were evaluated using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting. In vitro experiments using sarcoma (SRC) agonists and inhibitors were performed to investigate the impact of ACNO therapy on the expression of SRC, STAT3, and other proteins in HaCaT cells.
RESULTS: Metabolomic profiling revealed that diabetic wounds in mice exhibited marked metabolic dysregulation, which was attenuated by ACNO treatment. Key metabolites modulated by ACNO included mandelic acid, lactic acid, and 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid. The primary metabolic pathways involved were methyl histidine metabolism and the malate-aspartate shuttle. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed that ACNO therapy enhanced angiogenesis, promoted cellular proliferation, and facilitated diabetic wound closure. RT-qPCR data demonstrated that ACNO regulated the transcription of critical genes (SRC, STAT3, EGFR, and VEGFA). Notably, ACNO attenuated SRC/STAT3 pathway activation while concurrently upregulating EGFR and VEGFA expression.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasize the therapeutic potential of ACNO hydrogel in diabetic wound healing through the modulation of metabolic pathways and the SRC/STAT3 signaling axis. By correlating altered metabolites with molecular targets, this study elucidates the pharmacodynamic foundation for ACNO's preclinical application and provides valuable insights into the development of targeted therapies for diabetic wound management.","Mu X, Chen J, Zhu H, Deng J, Wu X, He W, Ye P, Gu R, Wu Y, Han F, Nie X",2025,13,N/A,Burns Trauma,"Mu X, et al.

40066486,A Comprehensive Review of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Management of Ulcerative Colitis.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, nonspecific inflammatory disorder characterized by symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, hematochezia, and urgency during defecation. While the primary site of involvement is the colon, UC can extend to encompass the entire rectum and colon. The causes and development mechanisms of UC are still not well understood; nonetheless, it is currently held that factors including environmental influences, genetic predispositions, intestinal mucosal integrity, gut microbiota composition, and immune dysregulation contribute to its development. Dysregulated immune responses are pivotal in the pathophysiology of UC, and these aberrant responses are considered key contributors to the disease onset. In patients with UC, immune cells become hyperactive and erroneously target normal intestinal tissue, resulting in inflammatory cascades and damage to the intestinal mucosa. The therapeutic strategies currently employed for UC include immunosuppressive agents such as aminosalicylates and corticosteroids. However, these treatments often prove costly and carry significant adverse effects - imposing a considerable burden on patients. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has attracted worldwide attention because of its multi-target approach, minimal side effects, cost-effectiveness, and favorable efficacy profiles. In this review, the ways in which TCM modulates inflammatory responses in the treatment of ulcerative colitis have been outlined. Research into TCM modalities for modulating inflammatory pathways in the treatment of UC, which has yielded promising advancements, including individual herbs, herbal formulations, and their derivatives, has been summarized. TCM has been utilized to treat UC and the immune system plays a key role in regulating intestinal homeostasis. It is imperative to facilitate large-scale evidence-based medical research and promote the clinical application of TCM in the management of UC.","Xu H, Zhu J, Lin X, Chen C, Tao J",2025,N/A,N/A,Am J Chin Med,"Xu H, et al.

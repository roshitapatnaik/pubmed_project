40052284,Mechanical Thrombectomy in Prestroke Disability: Data From the Italian Endovascular Stroke Registry.,"BACKGROUND: The benefits and safety of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in patients with prestroke disability, classified as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 3 to 4, and anterior circulation stroke remain uncertain. This study aims to evaluate these factors using data from the Italian Registry of Endovascular Treatment in Acute Stroke.
METHODS: We analyzed data collected between 2015 and 2021, comparing functional outcomes (mRS), symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and recanalization rates (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction) at 90 days post-MT in patients with prestroke mRS score of 3 to 4 versus 0 to 2. A good outcome was defined as no change in the mRS score from baseline. Subgroup analysis was stratified by age.
RESULTS: A total of 11.411 (96%) patients with prestroke mRS score of 0 to 2 and 477 (4%) patients with prestroke mRS score of 3 to 4 were included. Compared with patients with a baseline mRS score 0 to 2, those with mRS score 3 to 4 were older (82 versus 75 years; P&lt;0.001) and predominantly female (71.7% versus 53%; P&lt;0.001). The maintenance of the same mRS score after MT was observed in 100 (23.3%) patients with prestroke mRS score 3 to 4, compared with 2332 (22.1%) patients with mRS score 0 to 2 (P=0.556). Mortality was significantly higher in the mRS score 3 to 4 group (n=159 [37.1%] versus n=1939 [18.4%]; P&lt;0.001). Successful recanalization (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score ≥2b) was lower in the mRS score 3 to 4 group (n=333 [71.6%] versus n=8706 [77.7%]; P=0.002), while no significant differences in symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage were found. The benefit of MT was maintained in patients aged 80 to 85 and over 85 years with prestroke mRS score 3 to 4, although mortality remained higher.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that prestroke disability does not imply less chance of returning to prestroke conditions after MT, even in octogenarians, despite higher mortality and lower recanalization rate. More data are warranted to better understand the benefit of MT in this subgroup of patients.","Naldi A, D'Agata F, Pracucci G, Saia V, Cavallo R, Castellano D, Sallustio F, Casetta I, Fainardi E, Da Ros V, Maestrini I, Vinci SL, La Spina P, Limbucci N, Nencini P, Lafe E, Longoni M, Bracco S, Tassi R, Vallone S, Bigliardi G, Cerrato P, Castellan L, Del Sette M, Menozzi R, Pezzini A, Merolla S, Forlivesi S, Nappini S, Loizzo ND, Saletti A, Azzini C, Lazzarotti GA, Giannini N, Romano DG, Napoletano R, Burdi N, Boero G, Comai A, Dall'Ora E, Cavasin N, Critelli A, Plebani M, Cappellari M, Zimatore DS, Petruzzellis M, Biraschi F, Nicolini E, Sanna A, Tassinari T, Puglielli E, Casalena A, Gallesio I, Ferrandi D, Filauri P, Sacco S, Paladini A, Rizzo A, Besana M, Giossi A, Pavia M, Invernizzi P, Amistà P, Russo M, Filizzolo M, Mannino M, Galvano G, Saracco EL, Bergui M, Mangiafico S, Toni D, IRETAS Collaborators",2025,N/A,N/A,Stroke,"Naldi A, et al.

40052526,Focal Point Association of Core-Crystalline Micelles with an Amphiphilic Corona Block.,"We report the preparation of star-like supermicelles by the secondary association of triblock comicelles or scarf-like micelles driven by a change in solvency. These building blocks were synthesized by seeded growth in which crystallites of a triblock terpolymer, either PFS<sub>27</sub>-b-PTDMA<sub>81</sub>-b-POEGMA<sub>45</sub> (to form triblock comicelles) or PFS<sub>66</sub>-b-PTDMA<sub>81</sub>-b-POEGMA<sub>45</sub> (to form scarf-like micelles), served as seeds for crystallization-driven self-assembly (CDSA). PFS-b-PTDMA unimers were added in the seeded growth step. The corona-forming block PTDMA-POEGMA is amphiphilic and sensitive to polarity changes of the solvents. We sought solvents in which the upper critical solution temperature (UCST, T<sub>UCST</sub>) of POEGMA was slightly above room temperature (RT). Examples included 1-decanol and 1-decanol/decane mixtures. Seeded growth proceeded normally in solvents above the UCST of POEGMA. When the solution temperature was lowered below T<sub>UCST</sub>, or when the triblock comicelles or scarf-like micelles were transferred to a solvent (e.g., 1-decanol) below its T<sub>UCST</sub>, the center blocks associated to form star-like supermicelles. The addition of small amounts of THF to the medium to increase the solvency for POEGMA led to dissociation of the supermicelles. Transfer of the triblock comicelles to 1-pentanol at RT, below the UCST of PTDMA, also led to controlled secondary association to form supermicelles with a different morphology. Seeded growth with PFS<sub>25</sub>-b-PDMAEMA<sub>184</sub> unimers led to supermicelles in which the poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) corona chains could serve as carriers for gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). These AuNP@supermicelle complexes could serve as recoverable catalysts, for example to catalyze the condensation polymerization of bis(dimethylsilyl)benzene and pentanediol. They were highly active catalysts and showed excellent mechanical robustness for recovery and reuse.","Song S, Xu JT, Zhou H, Manners I, Winnik MA",2025,N/A,N/A,J Am Chem Soc,"Song S, et al.

40056846,Pattern formation of network epidemic model and its application in oral medicine.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The prevention and control of infectious diseases is one of the major public safety issues in the 21 st century. In this paper, a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model with disease recurrence behavior is established based on continuous space and network environment. The Turing pattern, optimal control and parameter identification of infectious disease models under different network structures are studied.
METHODS: We analyze the sufficient conditions for the existence of the disease equilibrium point of the system, and discuss the necessary conditions of Turing instability of the system on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, respectively. Our work further derives the global optimal solution of the parameters under the target pattern based on optimal control theorem.
RESULTS: The validity of the theoretical analysis is verified by a series of numerical simulations. Meanwhile, we have explored the impact of disease recurrence rate on the spread of infectious diseases on three network structures. It is found that when the recurrence rate α increases, it will result in a decrease in the recovered population R as well as an increase in the infected population I. Furthermore, the public Corona Virus Disease 2019 data are used for fitting verification. The verification results are basically consistent with the development trend of the epidemic, as well as the validity of the model is visually demonstrated.
CONCLUSIONS: The complex network model can more accurately simulate the dynamic propagation process of infectious diseases. Combined with optimal control and parameter identification methods, it can provide theoretical support for public health departments to prevent and control infectious diseases. In particular, optimization parameter identification technology can be successfully applied to oral image recognition and adjuvant therapy.","Zhu L, Li Y, He L, Shen S",2025,264,N/A,Comput Methods Programs Biomed,"Zhu L, et al.

40064138,Investigation of the protein corona and biodistribution profile of polymeric nanoparticles for intra-amniotic delivery.,"When exposed to the biological environment, nanoparticles (NPs) form a protein corona that influences delivery profile. We present a study of protein corona formation and NP biodistribution in amniotic fluid (AF) for poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(lactic-acid) (PLA) NPs, with and without polyethylene glycol (PEG), as well as poly(amine-co-ester)-PEG (PACE-PEG) NPs. The presence of surface PEG and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were characterized to investigate surfactant role in determining protein corona formation. The surface density of PEG groups demonstrated an inverse correlation with the total amount of protein surface adsorption. All PEGylated NPs exhibited a dense brush conformation and demonstrated higher levels of stability in AF than non-PEGylated NPs. The protein corona composition varied by core polymer, while the amount of protein adsorption varied by PEGylation status. In A549 cells, in vitro cellular association of each NP type correlated with the amount of albumin that was found in the protein corona. In vivo, only PEGylated NPs were able successfully distribute to fetal organs, likely due to the enhanced stability imparted by PEG. PLGA-PEG and PACE-PEG NPs had both high levels of albumin in the protein corona and high biodistribution to the fetal lung, consistent with the association with lung cells in vitro. PLA-PEG NPs distributed exclusively to the fetal bowel, which we propose is associated with known gastrointestinal targeting keratin proteins. By furthering our understanding of polymeric NP behavior in AF, this novel study provides a basis for optimization of intra-amniotic NP delivery systems targeting congenital pulmonary and gastrointestinal diseases.","Lynn AY, Shin K, Eaton DA, Rose M, Zhang X, Ene M, Grundler J, Deschenes E, Rivero R, Bracaglia LG, Glazer PM, Stitelman DH, Saltzman WM",2025,320,N/A,Biomaterials,"Lynn AY, et al.

40064840,Predictors of venous thromboembolic events in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.,"COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized patients. Although prior studies have attempted to identify predictors of VTE, restricted sample size and use of administrative claims data have limited such analyses. We utilized data from hospitalized patients in the CORONA-VTE Network, a United States multicenter registry of adult patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (N = 3,844). The primary outcome was time-to-first event for a composite of adjudicated pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis during 90-day follow-up. The candidate variables were selected by a priori clinical consensus. We conducted cause-specific Cox regression analysis adjusted for the selected variables for each imputed dataset and pooled the estimated HRs for reporting (p < 0.05 for significance). VTE occurred in 206 patients, with a cumulative incidence of 5.3% at 90 days. The covariates associated with increased risk of VTE were history of VTE (HR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.11-2.63), corticosteroid therapy (HR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.32-2.33) and known thrombophilia (HR: 3.56; 95% CI: 1.54-8.21) while therapeutic anticoagulation at baseline (HR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.26-0.69), antecedent use of statins (HR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.50-0.90), and prophylactic anticoagulation during hospitalization (HR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.38-0.71) were associated with reduced risk of VTE. While prior VTE, corticosteroid therapy, and known thrombophilia were associated with an increased risk of VTE, prescriptions of prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation, and statins were associated with a decreased risk. Once externally validated, these findings may inform risk assessment in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Scimeca G, Krishnathasan D, Rashedi S, Lan Z, Sato A, Hamade N, Bejjani A, Khairani CD, Davies J, Porio N, Assi AA, Armero A, Tristani A, Ortiz-Rios MD, Nauffal V, Almarzooq Z, Wei E, Zuluaga-Sánchez V, Zarghami M, Achanta A, Jesudasen SJ, Tiu B, Merli GJ, Leiva O, Fanikos J, Sharma A, Rizzo S, Pfeferman MB, Morrison RB, Vishnevsky A, Hsia J, Nehler MR, Welker J, Bonaca MP, Carroll B, Goldhaber SZ, Campia U, Bikdeli B, Piazza G",2025,N/A,N/A,J Thromb Thrombolysis,"Scimeca G, et al.

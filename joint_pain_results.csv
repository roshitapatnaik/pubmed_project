40056513,Lysozyme modulates inflammatory responses to exacerbate the severity of rheumatoid arthritis.,"BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) remain unclear. Despite having relatively well-defined treatment strategies, current therapeutic approaches only achieve a remission rate of 70 %-80 %, with poor prognosis and no clear diagnostic criteria for early RA. Therefore, there is a need for new therapeutic targets or biomarkers to improve the treatment of RA.
METHODS: Firstly, we identified the expression characteristics of lysozyme (LYZ) in early RA patients through plasma proteomics and synovial fluid single-cell sequencing analysis. Secondly, we constructed Lyz1 cKO mice to investigate the role of Lyz1 in RA pathogenesis using the Collagen Antibody-Induced Arthritis (CAIA) mouse model. Thirdly, we silenced LYZ to clarify its impact on TNF-α-induced inflammatory cytokine release and other inflammatory phenotypes in MH7A cells. Finally, we explored the cellular pathways involving LYZ in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) and changes in RA-related genes through RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq).
RESULTS: LYZ was highly expressed in the plasma and synovial macrophages of early RA patients. The absence of Lyz1 reduced the arthritis course and joint damage in CAIA mice. Silencing LYZ promoted the proliferation and apoptosis of MH7A cells and improved their inflammatory phenotypes, possibly through the regulation of the TNF signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: LYZ is highly expressed in the plasma and synovial fluid macrophages of early RA patients and exacerbates RA progression by modulating inflammation-related pathways, demonstrating potential as a biomarker for early RA diagnosis or a therapeutic target.","Xu H, Yin L, Zou L, Zhang E, Cheng Y, Zhang W, Liu Y, Han J, Zhao Y",2025,152,N/A,Int Immunopharmacol,"Xu H, et al.

40057210,Robotic-Assisted Surgery Does Not Decrease Prosthetic Impingement in Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Retrieval Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Prosthetic impingement after total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been associated with instability and may be a cause of accelerated polyethylene wear and pain. Previous retrieval studies report a high prevalence of impingement in acetabular liners. Robotic technology has the potential to reduce THA instability as it enables technical precision and optimizes implant positioning. However, whether robotics can improve impingement prevalence is unknown. Thus, the objectives of this study were to (1) determine the prevalence and severity of acetabular liner impingement with robotic navigation and (2) compare impingement prevalence with a control cohort of manually placed THA liners.
METHODS: There were 18 robotic-assisted liners and 11 non-robotic controls scored for the presence and severity of impingement. Radiographic measurements of acetabular inclination and anteversion were assessed using pre-revision standing radiographs. Femoral head size (36 being the most common), length of implantation (LOI), revision indication, age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) were recorded.
RESULTS: Of the robotic liners, 61% showed impingement, while 45% of the non-robotic liners showed impingement (P = 0.14). The robotic group demonstrated a lower variance of inclination (robotic: 41.7° + 3.9, control: 42.8° + 7.1, P = 0.64) and lower anteversion variance (robotic: 22.8° + 2.8, control: 20.8° + 7.9, P = 0.43), but mean values did not differ between the groups. Impingement presence and severity were not related to head size, LOI, or other demographic variables.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the use of robotic-assisted technology employing modern-day implants with larger diameter heads does not reduce the prevalence or severity of prosthetic impingement in retrieved acetabular liners from revision THA.","Sacher SE, O'Donnell J, Wright TM, Debbi EM, Padgett DE",2025,N/A,N/A,J Arthroplasty,"Sacher SE, et al.

40057247,Perioperative Integration of Palliative Care and Urology For Patients with Serious Urologic Illness: A Qualitative Need Finding Inquiry.,"BACKGROUND: Many urologic serious illnesses are treated with surgical procedures, which may put patients at a further risk of diminished quality of life.
AIM: To understand stakeholder perceptions on integrating perioperative Palliative Care (PC) for patients with serious urologic illness.
DESIGN: We conducted semi-structured interviews and team-based thematic analysis to consensus with a dual review.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Purposefully sampled urologists, palliative care physicians, and clinical team members at fourteen geographically distributed Veteran Health Administration sites.
RESULTS: We identified one general overall theme, to ""change culture"" so that PC is not a ""last resort,"" and three opportunities along the perioperative continuum for integrating urology and PC. Opportunity 1: Utilizing telehealth and team member role expansion when discussing the initial diagnosis, with surgery as a potential treatment option, allows for multiple conversations ""so they're not rushed in 15 minutes to mentally deal with the new diagnosis."" Opportunity 2: Creating a process to ensure goal of care conversations occur, since ""urologic procedures can have complications that significantly impact quality of life,"" which ""would require changing how our workflow is structured."" Opportunity 3: During the pre-operative visits, interdisciplinary input and evaluation of the patient prior to surgery allows the patient to ""have a sort of joint meeting with us and the urologist."" This represented the last point in time to de-escalate and offer non-surgical options prior to surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: The study informs future interventions to improve the quality of surgical care by integrating PC with urology in a unified workflow.","Maheta BJ, Singh NK, Bergman J, Brown-Johnson CG, Gunturi A, Interrante N, Leppert JT, Lorenz KA, Raspi IG, Giannitrapani KF",2025,N/A,N/A,J Pain Symptom Manage,"Maheta BJ, et al.

40057453,Effects of Mirror Therapy-Based Upper Extremity Exercises After Thoracotomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy of mirror therapy-based upper extremity exercises on shoulder pain, shoulder functions, quality of life, and fear of re-injury.
DESIGN: Single-blind randomized controlled prospective study.
METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled study included patients who underwent surgery using the posterolateral-thoracotomy method. Patients were randomly divided into two groups as control (n = 40) and study group (n = 40). Patients were included in the pulmonary rehabilitation program 5 days a week for 4 weeks. In addition, the study group patients performed the upper extremity exercises in the rehabilitation program in front of a mirror. Pain, shoulder joint range of motion, shoulder muscle strength, shoulder function, quality of life, and kinesiophobia were evaluated before surgery and 4 weeks after the intervention.
RESULTS: A statistically significant improvement was observed in the study group when comparing shoulder flexion and abduction muscle strength before surgery (Median; 141; 119) with after 4 weeks (Median; 155; 138) (p = .027; p = .019). When the changes from baseline to 4 weeks were compared, there were statistically significant differences between the groups in all results except shoulder external rotation muscle strength (p < .050).
CONCLUSIONS: Mirror therapy-based upper extremity exercises, which is added to the physiotherapy and rehabilitation program after thoracotomy, provides benefits such as pain relief, reduction of kinesiophobia, improvement of shoulder functions and improvement of quality of life.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Thoracotomy may cause shoulder pain and limitation of shoulder functions. Shoulder pain causes changes in the motor cortex and structural and functional changes that affect muscle activation. Central sensitization plays a role in events such as shoulder pain and dysfunction. Recently, mirror therapy has been used in the treatment program for upper extremity injuries and pain. Mirror therapy can provide consistent visual feedback when performing upper extremity exercises. Mirror therapy applied after thoracotomy can reduce shoulder pain and kinesiophobia. The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05962736).","Aksu NT, Başkurt Z, Keskin H",2025,N/A,N/A,Pain Manag Nurs,"Aksu NT, et al.

40057588,A comparison of conventional intervention and home-based approach with head-mounted device for cervical spondylotic myelopathy after surgery.,"Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is rising in the aging population. This study evaluated conventional versus home-based exercise interventions with a head-mounted device in 75 patients. Participants were divided into conventional (N = 36) and home-based (N = 39) groups, assessed pre-surgery, 3-months post-surgery, and after an eight-week intervention. Outcomes included numeric pain rating scale (NRS), neck disability index (NDI), cervical spine range of motion (ROM), neck muscle strength, muscle activation during movement, and cervical proprioception. A two-way mixed ANOVA was used to explore the main effects and interactions between groups and time points. ANCOVA adjusted for potential baseline differences. Both groups improved in NRS (P = 0.003), NDI (P = 0.001), and ROM in flexion (P < 0.001) and extension (P < 0.001) after exercise, while the home-based group showed significantly greater ROM in rotation (left, P = 0.026; right, P = 0.006), greater muscle strength (flexors, P < 0.001; extensors, P < 0.001), and lower sternocleidomastoid muscle activation (P < 0.001). The home-based group exhibited lower reposition errors post-exercise than the conventional group (Variable error during extension, P < 0.001; root mean square error during flexion, left and right rotation, P < 0.001 for all). The home-based intervention with a head-mounted device showed superior outcomes in mobility, muscle strength, proprioception, and muscle activation, surpassing pre-surgery levels and enhancing quality of life for CSM patients.","Yen LW, Chen HB, Rezaei A, Lien HY, Nikkhoo M, Cheng CH",2025,15,1,Sci Rep,"Yen LW, et al.

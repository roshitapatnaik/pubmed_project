40057888,Percutaneous Coronary Treatment With Bioadaptor Implant vs Drug-Eluting Stent: 2-Year Outcomes From BIOADAPTOR RCT.,"BACKGROUND: The sirolimus-eluting bioadaptor is a novel coronary implant that unlocks, separates, and maintains dynamic support of the vessel at the lesion site 6 months after percutaneous coronary intervention when the polymer coating covering the helical strands resorbs. This enables the bioadaptor to maintain the established flow lumen and to restore hemodynamic modulation of the artery, including cyclic pulsatility, vasomotion, and adaptive remodeling.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to report the first randomized clinical evidence of the DynamX bioadaptor implant through 2 years compared with the Resolute Onyx contemporary drug-eluting stent.
METHODS: This multicenter, single-blind, 1:1 randomized clinical trial was conducted at 34 hospitals in Japan, Europe, and New Zealand. The eligibility criterion was de novo coronary lesions in up to 2 vessels. The sample size was based on the primary endpoint, noninferiority of 12-month target lesion failure (TLF). The authors herein report 2-year outcomes.
RESULTS: In total, 445 patients were enrolled; 3 patients treated for in-stent restenosis and 2 who did not receive the assigned study device because of randomization error were excluded from the analysis. In the per-protocol population of patients with de novo native coronary lesions treated with the assigned device (n = 440), 2-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of TLF and target vessel failure rates in the bioadaptor group were lower (1.8% [4 of 219] vs 5.5% [12 of 221], risk difference -3.6% [95% CI: -7.8% to -0.0%; P = 0.044], and 1.8% [4 of 219] vs 5.9% (13 of 221), risk difference -4.1% [95% CI: -7.2% to -1.0%; P = 0.027], respectively). One clinically driven target lesion revascularization occurred between 6 months and 2 years in the bioadaptor group, whereas 2 cardiovascular deaths and 4 clinically driven target lesion revascularizations occurred in the drug-eluting stent group. The 2-year rate of definite or probable device thrombosis was 0.0% vs 0.5% (n = 1) (P = 0.32), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of 2-year outcomes comparing the bioadaptor implant with a contemporary drug-eluting stent. At 2-year follow-up, fewer TLF events were observed in patients treated with the bioadaptor.

40057872,"Prescribing Patterns of SGLT2 Inhibitors and GLP-1 Receptor Agonists in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes at Cardiology, Endocrinology, and Primary Care Visits.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the prescribing rates of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) at cardiology, endocrinology, and primary care visits in a community health system.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study using electronic health record data from Bon Secours Mercy Health outpatient clinics across Virginia (2019, 2020, 2021) included patients 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), or chronic kidney disease (CKD), and one or more outpatient visits. Adults with type 1 diabetes, stage 4/5 CKD, end-stage kidney disease, dialysis treatment, pregnancy, or hospice or palliative care were excluded. Prescribing rates were compared overall and for each subgroup among cardiology, endocrinology, and primary care visits using generalized linear mixed modeling with a random practice-level effect.
RESULTS: The 22,060 included patients had a mean age of 68 years, 50% were female (n=11,030), 41.3% were Black race (n=9,100), and 74.8% were Medicare beneficiaries (n=16,498). In addition, 17,724 patients (80.3%) had ASCVD, 5276 (23.9%) CKD, and 5,965 (27.0%) HF. Overall, prescriptions for either drug class occurred in 17.4% of eligible patients (n=3,849). Cardiology visits had the lowest prescribing rates overall and for each diagnosis subgroup compared with endocrinology and primary care visits in the raw, unadjusted, and adjusted models.
CONCLUSION: Overall prescribing rates for SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA were low among adults with type 2 diabetes and ASCVD, HF, or CKD. Additional research is warranted to identify barriers, and potential solutions, to improve prescribing of these therapies.","Dixon DL, Salgado TM, Robinson A, Carbone S, Wagner TD, Hyder H, Kirschner B, Musselman KT, Buffington TM, Sabo RT",2025,N/A,N/A,Mayo Clin Proc,"Dixon DL, et al.

40057866,Early Rhythm Control for Atrial Fibrillation in Patients With End-Stage or Chronic Kidney Disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the benefits and risks of early rhythm control (ERC) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This population-based cohort study included 5224 patients with AF (58.2% male, median age 70 years) with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD; n=1660) and CKD stage 3 to 4 (n=3564), who underwent ERC or rate control between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2015. A primary outcome consisted of cardiovascular death, ischemic stroke, heart failure-related hospitalization, and acute myocardial infarction.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 3.5 years, compared with rate control, ERC was associated with a reduced risk of the primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.98) without an increase in the composite safety outcome in CKD stage 3 to 4 (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.13). In patients with ESKD, there was no difference between rate control and ERC in the primary outcome (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.17) but an increase in composite safety outcome (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.50). During follow-up, 65.0% of patients with ESKD and 57.3% with CKD stage 3 to 4 failed to maintain ERC. In the on-treatment (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.99) and time-varying regression (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.98) analyses, ERC was associated with a lower risk of primary outcome even in patients with ESKD.
CONCLUSION: Early rhythm control revealed a modest risk-benefit profile in patients with ESKD compared with CKD stage 3 to 4, with poor adherence to ERC playing a major role. Therefore, an approach tailored to renal function should be considered for choosing AF treatment strategies.","Kang DS, Kim D, Jang E, Yu HT, Kim TH, Uhm JS, Sung JH, Pak HN, Lee MH, Yang PS, Joung B",2025,N/A,N/A,Mayo Clin Proc,"Kang DS, et al.

40057772,"Diabetes status, duration, and risk of dementia among ischemic stroke patients.","BACKGROUND: The influence of duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on the likelihood of developing new-onset dementia in post-stroke population is not well understood. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the relationship between the duration of T2DM and the risk of developing dementia in the post-stroke population.
METHODS: Leveraging the Korean National Health Insurance Database, this study included 118,790 individuals with a history of stroke but no previous dementia diagnosis. We classified diabetes status into five categories: normoglycemia, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), newly diagnosed T2DM, and established T2DM with durations of less than 5 years and 5 years or more. The primary endpoint was the incidence of all-cause dementia.
RESULTS: Among 118,790 participants (average age 64.26 ± 9.95 years, 48% male), 16.7% developed dementia during an average follow-up of 7.3 ± 2.3 years. Participants with a history of T2DM for less than five years at cohort entry had a 26.7% higher risk of developing all-cause dementia compared to those with normoglycemia. Those with T2DM for five years or longer had a 46.7% increased risk, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.466 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.408-1.527). Specifically, the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) rose by 43.4% and 51.4%, respectively, for individuals with T2DM lasting more than five years (aHR 1.434, 95% CI 1.366-1.505; aHR 1.514, 95% CI 1.365-1.679, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated a significant association between an extended duration of T2DM and an increased risk of developing all-cause dementia, including AD and VaD in post-stroke population. These results emphasize proactive dementia prevention approaches in stroke survivors, particularly those with longstanding T2DM.","Kim J, Han KD, Lee JY, Yang YS, Cheon DY, Lee JJ, Lee M",2025,17,1,Alzheimers Res Ther,"Kim J, et al.

40057770,Epigenome-wide association study for dilated cardiomyopathy in left ventricular heart tissue identifies putative gene sets associated with cardiac pathology and early indicators of cardiac risk.,"BACKGROUND: Methylation changes linked to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) affect cardiac gene expression. We investigate DCM mechanisms regulated by CpG methylation using multi-omics and causal analyses in the largest cohort of left ventricular tissues available.
METHODS: We mapped DNA methylation at ~ 850,000 CpG sites, performed array-based genotyping and conducted RNA sequencing on left ventricular tissue samples from failing and non-failing hearts across two independent DCM cohorts (discovery n = 329, replication n = 85). Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomisation (SMR) was applied to explore the causal contribution of sentinel CpGs to DCM. Fine-mapping of regions surrounding sentinel CpGs revealed additional signals for cardiovascular disease risk factors. Coordinated changes across multiple CpG sites were examined using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA).
RESULTS: We identified 194 epigenome-wide significant CpGs associated with DCM (discovery P < 5.96E-08), enriched in active chromatin states in heart tissue. Amongst these, 32 sentinel CpGs significantly influenced the expression of 30 unique proximal genes (± 1 Mb). SMR suggested the causal contribution of two sentinel CpGs to DCM and two other sentinel CpGs to the expression of two unique proximal genes (P < 0.05). For one sentinel CpG, colocalisation analyses provided suggestive evidence for a single causal variant underlying the methylation-gene expression relationship. Fine-mapping revealed additional signals linked to cardiovascular disease-relevant traits, including creatinine levels and the Framingham Risk Score. Co-methylation modules were enriched in gene sets and transcriptional regulators related to cardiac physiological and pathological processes, as well as in transcriptional regulators whose cardiac relevance has yet to be determined.
CONCLUSIONS: Using the largest series of left ventricular tissue to date, this study investigates the causal role of cardiac methylation changes in DCM and suggests targets for experimental studies to probe DCM pathogenesis.","Tan K, Tay D, Tan W, Ng HK, Wong E, Morley MP, Singhera GK, Lee CJM, Jain PR, Tai FL, Hanson PJ, Cappola TP, Margulies KB, Foo R, Loh M",2025,17,1,Clin Epigenetics,"Tan K, et al.

40066386,Allergen Immunotherapy in Autoimmune Terrain: A Case Study.,"Allergen immunotherapy (AIT), or specific immunotherapy (SIT), is an effective treatment for inducing immune tolerance to specific allergens. It is widely used for allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma, and Hymenoptera venom allergies, with recent applications to food allergies and atopic dermatitis. Despite its benefits, the use of SIT in patients with autoimmune diseases is controversial due to concerns about its potential to induce or exacerbate autoimmune conditions. This report examines a case of autoimmune hypothyroidism developing during AIT and the management decisions involved. A 26-year-old female with a history of moderate to severe persistent allergic rhinitis and childhood asthma presented with severe malaise, weakness, and fatigue over the past three months. She had a family history of asthma and allergic rhinitis. The patient had been on AIT for six months and was using intranasal fluticasone furoate nasal spray daily. Initial laboratory investigations prior to AIT showed normal thyroid function. Three months into AIT, she developed hypothyroidism, confirmed by elevated TSH levels and positive anti-TPO antibodies. A causality assessment suggested a ""possible"" link between AIT and hypothyroidism. However, a risk-benefit analysis favored the continuation of AIT along with the initiation of L-thyroxine therapy. After six months of thyroid hormone replacement, her TSH levels normalized, and her allergic rhinitis symptoms significantly improved. This case underscores the complexity of managing coexisting allergic and autoimmune conditions. The decision to continue AIT, despite the onset of hypothyroidism, was based on a thorough risk-benefit analysis, emphasizing the need for personalized treatment plans. Understanding the immunological mechanisms, particularly the balance between Th17 and Treg cells, is crucial. Neutrophils play a significant role as both effectors and modulators of immune responses. The clinical pharmacologist's recommendation was informed by these factors and the manageable nature of hypothyroidism with hormone replacement therapy. The continuation of AIT was justified by its benefits in managing allergic rhinitis and the manageable nature of hypothyroidism with hormone therapy. This case highlights the importance of personalized medicine and continuous monitoring in treatment decisions for patients with coexisting conditions.","Samajdar SS, Moitra S, Mukherjee S, Pal J, Joshi SR",2025,77,1,Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Samajdar SS, et al.

40066448,BLIMP-1-dependent differentiation of T follicular helper cells into Foxp3+ T regulatory type 1 cells.,"T-regulatory-type-1 (TR1) cells are a subset of interleukin-10-producing but Foxp3- Treg cells that arise in response to chronic antigenic stimulation. We have shown that systemic delivery of autoimmune disease-relevant peptide-major histocompatibility complex class II (pMHCII)-coated nanoparticles (pMHCII-NP) triggers the formation of large pools of disease-suppressing Foxp3- TR1 cells from cognate T-follicular helper (TFH) cell precursors. Here we show that, upon treatment withdrawal, these Foxp3- TR1 cells spontaneously differentiate into a novel immunoregulatory Foxp3+ TR1 subset that inherits epigenetic and transcriptional hallmarks of their precursors, including clonotypic T-cell receptors, and is distinct from other Foxp3+ Treg subsets. Whereas the transcription factor BLIMP-1 is dispensable for development of conventional Foxp3+ Treg cells, it is necessary for development of Foxp3+ TR1 cells. In a model of central nervous system autoimmunity, abrogation of BLIMP-1 or IL-10 expression in the Foxp3- and/or Foxp3+ TR1 subsets inhibits their development or anti-encephalitogenic activity. Thus, the TFH-TR1 transdifferentiation pathway results in the generation of two distinct autoimmune disease-suppressing, IL-10-producing TR1 subsets that are distinguished by the expression of Foxp3 and Foxp3 target genes.","Garnica J, Yamanouchi J, Clarke R, Moro J, Thiessen S, Monta√±o J, Mondal D, Serra P, Santamaria P",2025,16,N/A,Front Immunol,"Garnica J, et al.

40066484,Co-Delivery of Morphologically Switchable Au Nanowire and Hemoglobin-Resveratrol Nanoparticles in the Microneedle for Diabetic Wound Healing Therapy.,"Diabetic wounds are a common complication of diabetes and pose a significant threat to human health. High glucose concentration in the wound remains a major obstacle, necessitating effective strategies to achieve sustained glucose consumption for synergistic diabetic wound therapy. In this study, an Au-based nanomaterial is developed that can adjust its morphology in different therapeutic processes. The prepared Au nanowire (ANW) can be converted into Au nanospheres (AS) under ultrasonic conditions by adjusting the amount of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on its surface for convenient delivery. Intriguingly, AS is depolymerized into ANW again in the wound area, prolonging the retention time, and ensuring continuous consumption of glucose. After constructing the morphologically switchable Au nanowire, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is applied it to microneedle and co-delivered it with hemoglobin (Hb)-resveratrol (RES) nanoparticles for synergistic diabetic wound therapy. In a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse model, the microneedle degraded gradually, and the Hb-RES nanoparticles synergistically ameliorated hypoxia, scavenged ROS, and inhibited macrophage differentiation into pro-inflammatory M1 phenotypes. During this process, ANW continuously catalyzed glucose through its inherent glucose oxidase activity. Thus, this study provides novel insights into the long-term management of glucose concentration during synergistic diabetic wound healing.","Ye P, Yang Y, Liu M, Meng J, Zhao J, Zhao J, Wang J, Lu Q, Liu J, Wang L, Lei J, Wang C",2025,N/A,N/A,Adv Mater,"Ye P, et al.

40066520,Awareness and perceived risk of type 2 diabetes among older adults with HIV: results from a qualitative study.,"Older people with HIV (OPWH) have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Understanding this is important to screen and initiate treatments. This study explored awareness of T2DM, perceived risk, and willingness to receive T2DM preventive education. OPWH were recruited from an academic health center in Chicago, Illinois between November 2022 and January 2023. Staff used interview guides for qualitative data collection and administered a sociodemographic survey. Qualitative data was analyzed using the Framework Method; survey data was analyzed descriptively. A total of 19 participants were enrolled; the mean age was 59 years, and 37% were female. Thematic analysis revealed: (1) although participants were familiar with T2DM, they were largely unaware of the increased risk among individuals with HIV; (2) participants had divergent views regarding their own T2DM risk perception; (3) health maintenance was a motivator for T2DM prevention, yet participants noted lifestyle improvements may be difficult to implement; (4) participants were open to receiving diabetes prevention materials via the patient portal. Despite a general lack of awareness of T2DM risk among older adults with HIV, participants were willing to receive T2DM prevention information. Future research should develop plain language materials for OPWH and determine appropriate delivery procedures.","Alcantara K, O'Conor R, Masters MC, Svoboda S, Smith R, Yeh F, Wallia A, Bailey SC, Pack AP",2025,N/A,N/A,AIDS Care,"Alcantara K, et al.

40066547,Immune-Related Adverse Event of Immunotherapy: Diabetes.,"BACKGROUND: The development of immunotherapy has led to a paradigm shift in the treatment of malignant tumors. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) function by blocking the receptors and ligands of T cells from binding one another, empowering them to target and attack cancer cells. ICIs along with other immunotherapy treatments, have seen a significant increase in usage in recent years. However, this increased utilization has been accompanied by a significant rise in immune-related adverse events (irAEs). While the majority of irAEs reported are linked to endocrine dysfunction, less common irAES affecting the gastrointestinal, skin, hepatic, pulmonary, and cardiac systems have also been reported.
METHODS: In this report, we present a 72-year-old male patient with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in his left lobe, with 20% of their tumor cells positive for PD-L1. The patient's cells tested negative for actionable molecular markers, including as KRAS, EGFR, ALK, MET, and ROS1 alterations.
RESULTS: In accordance with the guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the patient was treated with a PD-1 inhibitor in combination with chemotherapy. Following treatment, the patient developed severe immunotherapy-related diabetes, which resolved after discontinuation of immunotherapy and the administration of insulin.
CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the potential complications of immunotherapy and underscores the critical role of experienced clinicians in recognizing the early warning signs of irAEs and effectively managing the resulting complications.","Su Q, Zhao L, Banfield JM, Lv Z, Jiang Y, Zhou X, Zhang Y, Fang Y, Wang Y",2025,71,3,Clin Lab,"Su Q, et al.

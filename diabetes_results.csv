40057763,Potential benefits of GLP-1 receptor agonist in dialysis patients with type 2 diabetes: the need for comprehensive pharmacokinetic and hemodialysis analyses.,"The 2022 KDIGO guideline for diabetes management in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) had endorsed the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) for patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes who did not achieve optimal glycemic target with maximally tolerated metformin and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor. Our study revealed the potential benefits of GLP-1RAs in patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney disease possibly owing to pleiotropic effects of the medicine. Nonetheless, pharmacokinetics and dialysis dose were omitted in our subgroup analyses. Herein, we would like to raise our concern regarding neglecting these important confounders in our analyses and the impact to the findings of the study.","Lai HW, Chen JY, Wu VC, See CY",2025,24,1,Cardiovasc Diabetol,"Lai HW, et al.

40057785,"Time-restricted eating (TRE) for obesity in general practice: study protocol of a controlled, randomized implementation study (INDUCT) within the Research Practice Network Baden-Wuerttemberg (FoPraNet-BW).","BACKGROUND: Obesity is a major health problem with a significant impact on quality of life and is a major risk factor for other diseases such as diabetes. There is a growing body of evidence that time-restricted eating (TRE) as one form of intermittent fasting (IF) represents a promising weight management strategy. Given the lack of evidence-based weight management strategies in the primary health care setting, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of TRE in general practice in Germany.
METHODS: INDUCT is a type hybrid I, randomized-controlled study conducted in 41 practices within the newly established general practice-based research network (GPBRN) in Baden-Wuerttemberg (FoPraNet-BW). The study population consists of patients with a Body Mass Index between 30-45 kg (kg)/m2. The intervention group receives TRE at the scheme 16:8 (16 h fasting; 8 h energy intake) while the control group receives care as usual. The primary outcome is change in body weight under a 6-month period of TRE. Secondary outcomes are related to the patient (e.g. quality of life) and the practice (e.g. knowledge about research in own practice). As the INDUCT study represents one of the first four use-cases within the Research Network Baden-Wuerttemberg (FoPraNet-BW), feasibility is a further secondary outcome. The target sample size is 208 patients with a 1:1 randomization. An intention-to-treat approach is used for data analysis.
DISCUSSION: INDUCT adds evidence on the effect of TRE as a weight management strategy in general practice. Relevant factors for a sustainable and successful implementation in general practice will be revealed and can be applied for future implementation of TRE interventions in general practice if proven successful. In addition, important lessons learned regarding the conduction of clinical research within FoPraNet-BW will be derived. This fosters a sustainable implementation of a research infrastructure in general practice in Germany.

40057833,Improved Graft Function and Decreased Post-transplantation Urinary Tract Infection after Azithromycin Dosing to Donors: A Pilot Study.,"PURPOSE: The rising trend of End-stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients requiring dialysis or transplantation needs a more therapeutic plan. As the best strategy for ESRD patients, kidney transplantation still needs outcome improvement. Macrolide drugs display antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties in chronic disease and intraoperatively and can concentrate in tissues for extended periods. Hence, theoretically, the drug prescription to the donor and accumulation in the kidney can cause graft immunomodulation and improve kidney transplantation outcomes.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This double-blinded randomized clinical trial was conducted on 62 eligible kidney donors randomly allocated to the azithromycin or placebo group and treated with a single dose (one gram) one day before surgery. The primary outcome was kidney graft function, and secondary outcomes included rejection rate, urinary tract infections in graft recipients, pain and systemic inflammatory response syndrome in live donors, and complications in donors and recipients. Outcomes were measured at baseline and every day in the first week after transplantation in both live donors and recipients and 30 and 90 days after transplantation. The adverse events were recorded as well.
RESULT: The mean age was 39 (SD, 13) years; 40% were women, and 11.6% were diabetic. Mean creatinine was 6.11 mL/min/1.73m2. Most patients in both arms were male (61.3%) and in early middle age. Hypertension was the most common cause of ESRD. Azithromycin could reduce the rejection rate in the first few days after kidney transplantation. Inflammatory mediators were lower in the azithromycin group, and fewer cases of urinary tract infection were found in the azithromycin group (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Azithromycin reduces adverse outcomes and enhances graft function. It would offer an intervention that is easy to use and economical, lowering post-transplant risks.","Teimoori M, Mokhtari G, Falahatkar S, Khosravi M, Momeni Moghaddam M, Taheri Z",2025,22,2,Urol J,"Teimoori M, et al.

40057872,"Prescribing Patterns of SGLT2 Inhibitors and GLP-1 Receptor Agonists in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes at Cardiology, Endocrinology, and Primary Care Visits.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the prescribing rates of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) at cardiology, endocrinology, and primary care visits in a community health system.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study using electronic health record data from Bon Secours Mercy Health outpatient clinics across Virginia (2019, 2020, 2021) included patients 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), or chronic kidney disease (CKD), and one or more outpatient visits. Adults with type 1 diabetes, stage 4/5 CKD, end-stage kidney disease, dialysis treatment, pregnancy, or hospice or palliative care were excluded. Prescribing rates were compared overall and for each subgroup among cardiology, endocrinology, and primary care visits using generalized linear mixed modeling with a random practice-level effect.
RESULTS: The 22,060 included patients had a mean age of 68 years, 50% were female (n=11,030), 41.3% were Black race (n=9,100), and 74.8% were Medicare beneficiaries (n=16,498). In addition, 17,724 patients (80.3%) had ASCVD, 5276 (23.9%) CKD, and 5,965 (27.0%) HF. Overall, prescriptions for either drug class occurred in 17.4% of eligible patients (n=3,849). Cardiology visits had the lowest prescribing rates overall and for each diagnosis subgroup compared with endocrinology and primary care visits in the raw, unadjusted, and adjusted models.
CONCLUSION: Overall prescribing rates for SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA were low among adults with type 2 diabetes and ASCVD, HF, or CKD. Additional research is warranted to identify barriers, and potential solutions, to improve prescribing of these therapies.","Dixon DL, Salgado TM, Robinson A, Carbone S, Wagner TD, Hyder H, Kirschner B, Musselman KT, Buffington TM, Sabo RT",2025,N/A,N/A,Mayo Clin Proc,"Dixon DL, et al.

40057880,Assessing the Efficacy of Spinal Cord Stimulation in Managing Painful Diabetic Neuropathy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus affects more than half a billion people globally, often leading to painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN). Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has emerged as a promising treatment for PDN.
OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy of SCS compared with the best medical therapy (BMT) for PDN.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a systematic search of the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL data bases was conducted up to December 1, 2023 and updated on January 2, 2025. Data extraction was performed using Microsoft Excel, and quality assessment was conducted using Cochrane's Risk of Bias 2.0 and ROBINS-1 tools. Statistical analysis and heterogeneity assessment were performed using Review Manager (RevMan) software (The Cochrane Collaboration, London, UK).
RESULTS: Nine clinical trials involving 407 patients were included. The analysis revealed significant pain reduction in the SCS group (mean difference [MD]: -5.46, 95% CI: [-6.09, -4.83], p < 0.00001). Subgroup analysis indicated pain relief benefits in both conventional SCS (MD: -4.176, 95% CI: [-4.865, -3.486], p < 0.001) and 10-kHz SCS (MD: -4.581, 95% CI: [-6.376, -2.785], p < 0.001). SCS also achieved higher treatment success rates (≥50% pain relief) than did BMT (risk difference: 0.59, 95% CI: [0.33, 0.85], p < 0.00001). Moreover, SCS significantly improved the EuroQol-5 Dimension utility index (MD: 0.16, 95% CI: [0.10, 0.23], p < 0.00001) and self-reported health (MD: 15.29, 95% CI: [4.51, 26.07], p = 0.005).
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis provides robust evidence supporting SCS as an effective intervention for managing chronic pain and enhancing the quality of life in patients with PDN, highlighting its superiority to conventional medical therapy.","Abbas A, Abouelmagd M, El-Moslemani M, Diaa A, Samir A, Ellabban MH, Bakr A, Taha AM, Hefnawy MT, El Din Moawad MH, Abo-Elnour DE, Hussein A, Awad H, Rashad A, Negida A, Raslan AM",2025,N/A,N/A,Neuromodulation,"Abbas A, et al.

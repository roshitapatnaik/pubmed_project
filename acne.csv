40061169,Ablative CO<sub>2</sub> Laser Treatment of Rhinophyma in People of Color: A Case Series.,"Rhinophyma is the result of progressive acne rosacea, which results in hypertrophy and fibrosis of sebaceous glands and connective tissues of the nose. The skin soft tissue envelope of the nose becomes bulkier and heavier relative to the underlying structural supportive framework of the nose over time, resulting in nasal airway obstruction and disfigurement that adversely impact quality of life. It is classically taught that rhinophyma is a disease that more commonly affects men, White people, and those in middle age. There are multiple treatment modalities available for rhinophyma aimed at surgical reduction of the overgrown skin soft tissue envelope, including CO<sub>2</sub> laser-assisted surgical excision. Rhinophyma also occurs in people of color, including Latin Americans, Native Americans, Black people, and others, although the condition is rare in these populations. There is less written about the limits of laser-related treatments in these populations. We present a case series of 7 patients with melanated skin and moderate to severe rhinophyma who were treated with CO<sub>2</sub> laser excision, with significant improvement in nasal appearance and functional nasal obstruction as a result. Three patients in the series developed some degree of scarring in the supratip and tip region that did not significantly deter the overall improvement in nasal aesthetics from treating the disease. A more conservative treatment plan with respect to the depth of resection may have limited scarring, or perhaps the traditional teaching to approach laser treatments in patients with melanated skin with caution due to risks of scarring is supported here.","Nganzeu CG, Lopez A, Brennan TE",2025,13,3,Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,"Nganzeu CG, et al.

40061678,Periodontal Diagnosis in a Young Patient with an Unusual Presentation of Dental Calculus.,"This report details the periodontal diagnosis and phase I treatment of an 18-year-old male patient dissatisfied with his teeth. The patient, on 20 mg Isotretinoin for acne, exhibited heavy calculus and plaque, generalized gingival inflammation, carious lesions, remaining roots, an anterior open bite, bilateral cross-bite, and an ectopically erupted tooth (#25). Initial scaling enabled examination, revealing FMPS and FMBS of 100%, PD of 1-7 mm, gingival recession of 1-2 mm, a maximum CAL of 6 mm, and radiographic bone loss of around 48% of teeth, reaching up to 15% of the root length. Diagnosed with generalized periodontitis (stage II, localized stage III, grade B), treatment involved patient education, scaling, selective root planning, and a long-term maintenance plan. At reevaluation, the patient showed improved oral hygiene, reduced FMPS (33%) and FMBS (11%), fewer pockets, and decreased PD and CAL (deepest CAL now 6 mm). Early periodontal intervention and consistent oral hygiene are critical for subsequent dental treatments.","Ababneh KT, Nafisah SA, Maslamani M, Al Asiri T",2024,16,Suppl 5,J Pharm Bioallied Sci,"Ababneh KT, et al.

40062686,Systemic Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Isotretinoin: Evaluation of Red Cell Distribution Width to Lymphocyte and Platelet Ratios as New Hematological Markers and Clinical Outcomes in Acne Vulgaris.,"BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin disease influenced by systemic immune responses. While isotretinoin is the most effective treatment for severe acne, its effects on hematological markers of inflammation, in particular red cell distribution width (RDW)-to-lymphocyte and RDW-to-platelet ratios, remain unclear.
METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed 450 acne patients treated with isotretinoin for at least 24 weeks. Hematological parameters, including complete blood count (CBC) indices, RDW-derived ratios, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), as well as biochemical markers (ALT, AST, ALP) and clinical measures (lesion counts, Global Acne Grading Score [GAGS], Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI], SF-36, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]) at baseline and weeks 8, 16, and 24.
RESULTS: Isotretinoin treatment was associated with significant reductions in systemic inflammatory markers, including WBC count, NLR, and MLR, while lymphocyte count increased (p < 0.001). The ratios of RDW to lymphocytes and RDW to platelets also decreased over time (p < 0.001). Liver enzymes remained stable. Clinical assessments showed significant improvements in acne severity, quality of life, and mental health scores (p < 0.001). Adverse events were reported in 90.7% of patients, with musculoskeletal symptoms and constipation more common than previously reported.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the systemic immunomodulatory effects of isotretinoin, particularly the significant changes in RDW-derived ratios, suggesting their potential as novel inflammatory markers. These findings reinforce the broader effects of isotretinoin beyond sebaceous gland suppression and support its role in the regulation of systemic inflammation.","Demirbas A, Demirbas GU, Diremsizoglu E, Islamoglu G",2025,24,3,J Cosmet Dermatol,"Demirbas A, et al.

40063408,Upadacitinib Results in Endoscopic Remission in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Prior Tofacitinib Failure.,"GOALS: Assess the safety and effectiveness of upadacitinib in patients with prior tofacitinib failure.
BACKGROUND: Patients with severe, refractory Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) and inadequate response to medical therapy have a high risk of complications. A better understanding of treatment response in the setting of prior failure may improve disease control in high-risk patients. Currently, the response to a subsequent Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor after prior JAK failure is poorly understood.
STUDY: We retrospectively assessed the safety and effectiveness of upadacitinib in patients with prior tofacitinib failure.
RESULTS: We report on 26 patients (10 UC, 16 CD) treated with upadacitinib after tofacitinib failure. Mean age 40.2 years, mean disease duration 14.4 years (range 2 to 33), and previously failed a median of 5 advanced therapies. The mean upadacitinib treatment duration was 13.9 months (SD 4.5). On upadacitinib, 83.3% (n=10/12) of patients achieved clinical response, 66.7% (n=8/12) clinical remission, 71.4% (n=10/14) endoscopic improvement, 57.1% (n=8/14) endoscopic remission, and 35.7% (n=5/14) endoscopic healing. The mean Simple Endoscopic Score in CD decreased from 14.3 (SD: 8.3) to 8.6 (SD: 9.0) (P=0.24). The mean Mayo Endoscopic Subscore significantly decreased from 2.7 (SD 0.8) to 0.9 (SD 1.2) (P=0.006). 73.1% of patients on upadacitinib reported adverse events, most commonly minor infections and acne. No serious adverse events, major cardiovascular events, malignancies, or Shingles were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Upadacitinib was tolerated in most patients and resulted in clinical and endoscopic improvement in the majority of patients with severe, refractory CD or UC with prior tofacitinib failure, regardless of previous clinical response to tofacitinib. Further studies would define the long-term safety, efficacy, and predictors of response after previous JAK exposure.","Lee SD, Kamp KJ, Jacobs J, Harper J, Barahimi M, Clark-Snustad KD",2025,N/A,N/A,J Clin Gastroenterol,"Lee SD, et al.

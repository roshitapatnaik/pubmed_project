40053637,ChromaGazer: Unobtrusive Visual Modulation Using Imperceptible Color Vibration for Visual Guidance.,"Visual guidance (VG) plays an essential role in directing user attention in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) environments. However, traditional approaches rely on explicit visual annotations, which often compromise visual clarity and increase user cognitive load. To address this issue, we propose an unobtrusive VG technique based on color vibration, a phenomenon in which rapidly alternating colors at frequencies above 25 Hz are perceived as a single intermediate color. Our work explores a perceptual state that exists between complete color fusion and visible flicker, where color differences remain detectable without conscious awareness of vibration. Through two experimental studies, we first identified the thresholds separating complete fusion, this intermediate perceptual state, and visible flicker by systematically varying color vibration parameters. Subsequently, we applied color vibrations with derived thresholds to natural image regions and validated their attention-guiding capabilities using eye-tracking measurements. The results demonstrate that controlled color vibration successfully directs user attention while maintaining low cognitive demand, providing an effective method for implementing unobtrusive VG in VR and AR systems.","Tosa R, Hattori S, Hiroi Y, Itoh Y, Hiraki T",2025,PP,N/A,IEEE Trans Vis Comput Graph,"Tosa R, et al.

40054156,Quantum-dot-spectrometer-based virtual barcode for the sensitive colorimetric urinalysis.,"Colorimetric sensing methods are extensively utilized for rapid and sensitive detection of various biomedical and environmental targets, with higher dimensional spectra resulting in more accurate results. Miniature reconstructive spectrometers, as portable colorimetric sensing devices, show promise in capturing high-dimension spectra signals, while facing the challenges of noise-sensitive spectrum reconstruction and complex pre-calibration. To address these issues, we present a virtual barcode method, which is directly based on the utilization of a high-dimension quantum dot (QD) spectrometer intensity vector. Any spectral changes of the analytes can be reflected in the corresponding barcode, without the redundant operation for spectral analysis. We demonstrate the QD barcode method in quantitatively detecting multiple biomarkers in the artificial human urine, including urinary calcium, glucose, nitrite, and creatinine, with lower limits of detection compared to the RGB sensing method (2.4-14.4-fold). To simplify the preparation of the QD spectrometer, we optimize both the number and the spectral distribution of QD filters. Furthermore, an artificial neural network model is also established to achieve 8-fold improved quantitative recognition performance. This QD barcode method can greatly broadens the biosensing application of miniaturized reconstructive spectrometers.","Huai B, Liu S, Zhang J, Liu X, Bao J",2025,278,N/A,Biosens Bioelectron,"Huai B, et al.

40059459,Sleep Deprivation-Induced Anxiety Alleviated by Oral Administration of 4-Aminopyridine in Male Mice.,"PURPOSE: Insufficient sleep and insomnia are common issues associated with modern lifestyles that often contribute to the development of mental health disorders. 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), a voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel antagonist, is commonly used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). It has been shown to improve nerve conduction velocity, strengthen myelin, and increase axonal area after injury. In addition, 4-AP has been reported to reduce behavioral disorders, including depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 4-AP on anxiety-like behavior in mice subjected to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation.
METHODS: Fifty male mice were randomly divided into five groups: control, normal saline (NS) (receiving normal saline via gavage), AP-0.25, AP-0.5, and AP-1 (receiving daily doses of 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg of 4-AP, respectively by gavage). All groups except the control group underwent SD for five consecutive days. The animals' locomotion and anxiety-like behavior were assessed using the open field and elevated plus maze tests. After behavioral testing, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPA-R), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) were measured by western blotting, and also malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were analyzed by ELISA in the hippocampus.
FINDING: AP-1 significantly reduced the levels of anxiety-like behavior compared to the NS group in both tests. In AP-1, a significant decrease in the levels of NMDA-R, AMPA-R, TNF-α, and MDA was observed. While these levels were increased in the NS group. In addition, AP-1 showed a higher level of TAC compared to the NS group, indicating an increase in antioxidant levels.
CONCLUSION: 4-AP may be effective in reducing anxiety-like behavior in sleep-deprived mice by modifying the levels of NMDA-R, AMPA-R, and TNF-α, while simultaneously reducing oxidative stress induced by sleep deprivation in the hippocampus.",Hosseini E,2025,15,3,Brain Behav,Hosseini E.

40059800,Effect of Orbicularis Oculi Muscle Suspension Combined With Overlap in Modified Sub-Brow Blepharoplasty: A Prospective Study.,"BACKGROUND: Sub-brow blepharoplasty (SBB) has emerged as one of the primary methods for addressing periorbital aging among East Asian women in recent years. Numerous surgeons have continued to refine and innovate this technique; however, challenges remain in maintaining the stability of surgical outcomes and addressing issues such as abnormal postoperative eyelid wrinkles.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to conduct a prospective clinical investigation to demonstrate that improvements in SBB techniques can lead to enhanced postoperative eyelid morphology and sustained long-term results.
METHOD: Between September 2021 and September 2022, we included 72 female patients who underwent the modified SBB procedure. In addition to recording baseline data prior to surgery, we evaluated surgical outcomes postoperatively using both subjective and objective items.
RESULT: The average age of the patients was 47.69 years, with a median grade of 2 for upper eyelid skin laxity. The mean length of excised tissue was 44.72 mm, while the average width was 9.66 mm. No significant differences were observed in the vertical distance from the superior brow edge to the center of the pupil at 6 and 12 months postoperation, measured at the inner edge of the iris, the center of the pupil, and the lateral canthus. Similarly, the GAIS scores showed no significant differences at 6 and 12 months postoperation.
CONCLUSION: In this study, the improved SBB technique successfully reduced or eliminated abnormal postoperative eyelid creases, ensuring stable outcomes and an aesthetically pleasing appearance.","Cui J, Zhang Y, Cang Z, Liu C, Cao J, Zhang Z, Fan X, Zhang X, Song B, Li Y",2025,24,3,J Cosmet Dermatol,"Cui J, et al.

40062817,Distribution of Globe Excursions Within the Orbits Monitored by Eye Tracking Glasses in Ambulatory Subjects Engaged in Their Normal Daily Activities.,"PURPOSE: It is unknown how gaze angle deviates over the course of normal daily activities, and whether its distribution is affected by vergence. To address these issues, an eye tracker was used to record eye positions in ambulatory subjects engaged in their usual pursuits.
METHODS: Twenty-seven normal subjects with a mean age of 23.6 years (range, 4-68 years) wore the eye tracking glasses, generating 328 min/person of usable data. Histograms were compiled to show the distribution of (1) horizontal gaze angles, (2) vertical gaze angles, and (3) vergence.
RESULTS: The histogram of horizontal gaze angles showed a bimodal distribution of vergence, with a distance peak at 1.6° and a near peak at 7.6°. The mean standard deviation of eye position was greater during far viewing (8.93°) than near viewing (6.65°). Horizontal eye position deviated by more than 25° from primary position less than 1% of the time. Vertical eye position shifted from a mean of -3.58° during far viewing to -8.54° during near viewing. Overall, the standard deviation of vertical eye position (11.63°) was greater than that of horizonal eye position (8.41°).
CONCLUSIONS: Deployment of a mobile eye tracker has revealed four main findings about eye position in the orbit. First, horizontal gaze angle remains within ±16.8° of primary gaze 95% of the time, reflecting an aversion to large horizontal ocular excursions. Second, mean vertical gaze position is shifted downward (-5.19°). Third, increased vergence is associated with a gaze shift downward. Fourth, increased vergence reduces the distribution of horizontal eye positions.","Zheng YJ, Gentry TN, Economides JR, Horton JC",2025,66,3,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,"Zheng YJ, et al.

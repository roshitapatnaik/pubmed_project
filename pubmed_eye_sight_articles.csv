40057660,Endophthalmitis caused by Enterococcus faecalis: cytological and bacteriological diagnosis using vitreous fluid.,"BACKGROUND: This case report aims to describe the diagnostic method and the clinical course of endophthalmitis caused by Enterococcus faecalis.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old man presented with sudden, severe pain and acute vision loss in his left eye. Ocular examination revealed significant intraocular inflammation and dense vitritis, suggesting endogenous endophthalmitis. Systemic evaluation identified colonic diverticulosis as a potential source of infection. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed, and analysis of the vitreous fluid, including cytological and bacteriological studies, confirmed the presence of Enterococcus faecalis.
CONCLUSION: The vitreous fluid is an adequate sample for characterizing endophthalmitis by combining cytological and bacteriological analyses.","Ramtohul P, Frankel D, Gouriet F, Delaporte C, David T, Roll P, Kaspi E",2025,15,1,J Ophthalmic Inflamm Infect,"Ramtohul P, et al.

40057009,Associations between Ambient Air Pollution and Five Common Vision-threatening Ocular Diseases in Middle-aged and Older Adults: A Large Prospective Cohort Study.,"PURPOSE: Ambient air pollution may exacerbate ocular conditions; however, comprehensive research on the effects of various pollutants remains limited. To evaluate the association between multiple air pollutants and the incidence of five common vision-threatening ocular diseases: cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal detachment.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study METHODS: We included 114,930 participants with refractometry at baseline in this prospective cohort study based on data from the UK Biobank. Annual average concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and particulate matter (PM) with diameters &lt; 2.5 (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and &lt; 10 Î¼m (PM<sub>10</sub>) were assessed using land use regression models. Restricted cubic spline models and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to estimate the association between air pollution exposure and ocular disease incidence, with stratified analyses based on myopia status.
RESULTS: An interquartile range increase in PM<sub>10</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> was significantly associated with a higher risk of diabetic retinopathy among participants with myopia, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.11 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.23) and 1.22 (95% CI: 1.02-1.45), respectively. PM<sub>10</sub> was linked to 9% increase in retinal detachment incidence in the myopic population and PM<sub>2.5</sub> was linked to 8% increase in glaucoma incidence in the nonmyopic population. High PM<sub>10</sub> exposure was associated with a 61% higher risk of diabetic retinopathy in the myopic group. Further stratified analysis revealed that the impact of PM<sub>10</sub> on diabetic retinopathy was more pronounced in individuals with low-to-moderate myopia than in those with high myopia. High PM<sub>10</sub> exposure also correlated with a 67% higher risk of retinal detachment and a 44% higher risk of macular degeneration in the low-to-moderate myopic population.
CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to high levels of PM<sub>10</sub> was associated with an increased risk of diabetic retinopathy and retinal detachment, highlighting the importance of addressing air pollutants as an intervention for vision-threatening ocular diseases.","Wang Z, Yu Y, Ye Y, Wang L, Bao Y, Wang X, Zhou X, Zhao J",2025,N/A,N/A,Am J Ophthalmol,"Wang Z, et al.

40056051,Evidence on the Use of Topical Ciclosporin for Ocular Surface Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: To identify evidence on the use of topical CsA for ocular surface diseases (OSD).
METHODS: A literature search was conducted following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) through June 2023 via Cochrane Central Registries, Clinical Trials Registry, Grey literature and citation searching. Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) in which different concentrations of topical CsA were compared with one another or other topical therapies were included. Risk of bias was assessed following the Cochrane ROB2 standard tool. Meta-analysis was considered when data were sufficient. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE).
RESULTS: Five hundred and eight-three RCT publication titles were identified, of which 48 OSD RCTs were included. Thirty trials found significantly better efficacy with CsA irrespective of dose or concentration for OSD. The effect of CsA was comparable to artificial tears (AT), vehicle, fluorometholone 0.1%, tacrolimus 0.03% or diquafosol 3% only in 13 trials. Improved outcomes with CsA for symptoms (RCTs comprising 1107-patients) and clinical signs, including in ocular surface staining (2505-patients) and the average number of goblet cells (138-patients) were found. Inconsistency of treatment effect on symptoms and signs, particularly tear film function, was evident in some trials. Ten trials were judged to be at high risk of bias. The certainty of evidence was judged to be low to moderate, downgraded mostly for imprecision and risk of bias.
CONCLUSIONS: Topical CsA treatment effect on ocular surface symptoms and staining suggests that CsA may be superior to the vehicle, AT or other topical treatment alternatives for OSD.","Chidi-Egboka NC, Fan L, Qureshi M, Samarawickrama C, Stapleton F, Trinh T, Markoulli M, Chan E, Chen JY, Holland J, Watson SL",2025,N/A,N/A,Clin Exp Ophthalmol,"Chidi-Egboka NC, et al.

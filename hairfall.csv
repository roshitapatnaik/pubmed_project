29200562,Prevalence and Sociodemographic Profile of Lithium-induced Cutaneous Side Effects in Bipolar Affective Disorder Patients: A 1-year Prospective Observational Study in South India.,"OBJECTIVES: Objective in our study is i) To assess the prevalence and sociodemographic profile of cutaneous side effects in bipolar affective disorder patients (BPAD) on lithium. ii) To assess the course of pre-existing skin reactions, when patient is initiated on lithium therapy.
METHODS: Lithium induced cutaneous side effects were assessed at baseline and monthly for 6 months followed by every 2 months over a year. Dermatologist opinion obtained to diagnose and treat for each patient who developed cutaneous side effects. Data were analyzed in percentage.
RESULTS: The prevalence of lithium induced cutaneous side effects in our study is 38.46%. On analyzing the individual subtype of cutaneous lesions, acneiform eruption and hairfall were most common. The cutaneous adverse reactions on lithium are more common in early adulthood than in the late adulthood and geriatric age group and among the subtypes of skin lesion acneiform eruptions are more common among males than in females. On analyzing the course of pre-existing lesions, severe alopecia developed with pre-existing systemic lupus erythematosis.
CONCLUSION: These novel finding indicate that prevalence of lithium induced cutaneous side effects continues to be high. Hence, clinician should educate the patients before initiating lithium to improve attrition rate.","Suganya Priyadharshini BS, Ummar IS",2017,39,5,Indian J Psychol Med,Suganya Priyadharshini BS and Ummar IS.

30290853,Innovative Method for the Analysis of Dexpanthenol in Hair Care Products.,"Background: Dexpanthenol is a widely used humectant in hair care products, especially anti-hairfall products. The hair care industry is highly regulated in East Asia and treats products containing the combination of dexpanthenol, zinc pyrithione, and nicotinamide (vitamin B₃) as quasi-drugs. Objective: Because dexpanthenol lacks a UV chromophore, existing methodologies for analysis in finished products include pretreatments and/or HPLC-UV analysis at low wavelengths at which poor signal-to-noise is observed. These time-consuming methods lack the robustness needed for routine use in quality laboratories. This has resulted in the need for a simple, fast, accurate, and robust UHPLC-MS method to quantify dexpanthenol in hair care products that could be easily adapted in quality laboratories. Methods: The MS detection was performed in positive ion mode with data acquired in single-ion recording for dexpanthenol (206.14 m/z), dexpanthenol-d<sub>6</sub> (212.29 m/z), and Leucine Enkephalin acetate salt (556.28 m/z). Quantitation was performed using peak area ratio of dexpanthenol to the internal standard. Results: The resulting linear curve R² was 0.9998 with sample precision RSDs &lt;2.5%. The accuracy recoveries were within 2% and the robustness results were within 3% of the nominal conditions. Conclusions: The resulting method for the quantitation of dexpanthenol is fast, accurate, and robust in the range of 170.24-1024.5 ng/mL in shampoo and conditioner, which is easily adaptable in quality laboratories. Highlights: This study determined optimal sample preparation and UHPLC-MS conditions to quantify dexpanthenol in finished hair care products.","Weiss CL, Fairchild MR, Stanton B, Nshime BS, Parkanzky PD",2019,102,2,J AOAC Int,"Weiss CL, et al.

30984584,"Dietary Protein Deficit and Deregulated Autophagy: A New Clinico-diagnostic Perspective in Pathogenesis of Early Aging, Skin, and Hair Disorders.","BACKGROUND: Diet has an important role to play in the well-being of human body.
AIMS: The study intends to establish the ""hypothesis of conscious, selective, and self-destruction i.e., deregulated autophagy of skin and hair in low dietary protein scenario"" by determining the facial profile, clinical presentation, and histopathological correlation of deficient protein intake and missing of meals in a tertiary care aesthetic skin institute.
METHODS: A total of 98 patients of skin- and hair-related complaints were enrolled in the study and a histopathological correlation was established by skin and scalp biopsies in high and low protein groups.
RESULTS: A significant number of subjects (68.4%) were taking less than half of the recommended daily allowance of proteins and faced problems like hair fall, acne, pigmentation, vitiligo, hirsutism, melasma, and premature aging. Subjects missing breakfast were found to have hypothyroidism, diffuse hairfall, autoimmune disorders like vitiligo, lichen planus, and alopecia areata. Histopathological images from submental area showed loose and fragmented collagen in high carbohydrate group in comparison to high protein group where thick, uniformly stained collagen bundles were found in dermis. Histopathology of scalp tissue showed chronic perifollicular inflammatory infiltrate and fibrosis in high carbohydrate group which was absent in histopathology specimen of high protein group. Patients taking early and nutrient-rich breakfast had higher mean protein intakes and less severe skin and hair problems suggesting a role of circadian rhythm as well.
CONCLUSION: Dietary protein adequacy and early breakfast have significant role in preventing self-destruction or deregulated autophagy in trichology and cosmetic dermatology and may prevent various autoimmune, inflammatory, and metabolic diseases.","Garg S, Sangwan A",2019,10,2,Indian Dermatol Online J,"Garg S and Sangwan A.

37105163,How hairfall saved the patient from cancer twice - A postmenopausal patient with synchronous endometrial and endocervical carcinomas presenting with endocrine symptoms.,"Ovarian stromal hyperthecosis is an uncommon nonneoplastic cause of ovarian hyperandrogenism mainly in postmenopausal women. Here, we present a case of a postmenopausal woman who presented with features of virilization like alopecia and hirsutism. During its workup, two malignancies were diagnosed at a very early stage. Microscopic focus of endometrial adenocarcinoma in a polyp and similar focus of endocervical adenocarcinoma in the subsequent hysterectomy specimen were noted. Presence of synchronous malignancies in the uterus is very rare and it being detected in a patient who presented with a non-related symptom of hairfall makes it an interesting case scenario.","Karangadan S, Nair IR, Menon U, Bhati P, Remadevi C",2023,29,2,Post Reprod Health,"Karangadan S, et al.
